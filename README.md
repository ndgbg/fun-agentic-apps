## What Makes These Apps "Agentic"?

These aren't just smart apps — they're **autonomous agents** that:
- 🎯 Operate independently without constant user input
- 💡 Proactively identify problems and suggest solutions
- 🧠 Reason through complex situations with explainable logic
- 📈 Learn from patterns and adapt recommendations
- 🎪 Pursue goals autonomously
